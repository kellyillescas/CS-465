CS 465 Travlr Website - Portfolio

In creating my site, I used several types of front-end development, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single page application (SPA). Initially, I used Express and Java. Express is used to dynamically 
render pages using routes and controllers. It has the ability to incorporate a great feature called handlebars, which are templates that are populated with data from a database. JavaScript is the language I used 
to program. The SPA is created using Angular. Angular is an amazing way to render pages dynamically that can be launched quickly and updated with ease. Additionally, components in Angular are reusable so this is 
a benefit for a programmer as it saves time and money. The back-end development consisted of a NoSQL database using MongoDB. Mongo is great because it doesn’t have to contain a specific amount of information for 
each item it queries. It is very versatile and can be retrieved in many different ways. It is also features scalability, a huge plus for web designers.

JSON is different from JavaScript. JavaScript brings the information to web pages and makes them interactive. JSON is a language that is derived from JavaScript, hence its name - JavaScript Object Notation. 
However, the similarities don’t go much further than that. JSON works by using types of data such as arrays, Booleans, objects, and strings, while JavaScript centers mostly on objects. A big difference between 
the two languages is that JavaScript objects depend upon the language of JavaScript only, while JSON can be read by many languages. JavaScript is represented by objects and can contain commented lines. On the 
other hand, JSON consists of only text (no commented lines) and must be presented in a string.

In the full stack process, I was able to refactor the code over and over after making changes. This refactoring led to the web pages being displayed in different ways, usually making improvements upon the pages 
or making them more efficient. One example is when I started using the handlebars templates. I liked the ease in which I was able to refactor and see the pages load dynamically. Additionally, when I began using 
the NoSQL MongoDB, I was able to add and edit changes on the website without having to use the back end. The benefits of reusable UI components like templates are that it improves efficiency, speed, and is much 
easier for the developer to create functional web pages that can be duplicated with very small changes. I would also imagine that if the site is huge, like Amazon for instance, using reusable UI components would 
make the site much more cost-efficient.

When we were working with HTTP, one of the most effective methods we used were the GET, POST, and PUT methods. PATCH, DELETE, and HEAD are some others, but I did not get to try those out for this project. The 
former three methods were used to make changes on a web page much simpler. As far as testing of endpoints, this proved to be the most useful method for me when determining if the coding I was doing gave me the 
result I desired, because all I needed to do was to load the webpage to see if the changes I made worked. Security in a full stack application was an incredibly useful addition. It allowed me to create a JWT, or 
JSON Web Token. This JWT allowed a user to log in and be authenticated in a secure way, while transmitting user data in JSON format.

This course has absolutely helped me in reaching my professional goals. I would love to get more insight into developing for the web, and this was an amazing introduction into the world of HTML and the MEAN 
stack. I know that I need more practice, but I feel that having this practice is a great way to get out there and learn even more. I was also able to sharpen my skills with JavaScript, a language I already enjoy 
using. This course can definitely help me become a more marketable candidate because the languages and skills used to develop this full stack application are ones that are preferred, and sometimes required, for 
many jobs in the software field.
